<h1>Top Best Movies according to FLEE</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Movies of all time.</h2><hr />
<h3>Finding Nemo</h3>
This isn't my favorite movie but it is most likely my son's favorite movie.
<h3>How to Train your Dragon</h3>
We just watched this movie the other night and it was a good movie to hold the toddler's attention yet still be entertaining for mom and dad.
<h3>Death and other Details</h3>
Death and other Details isn't a movie but a series I started watching two nights ago that really grabbed my interest.
