<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a middle aged (36) first time mom of one adorable beyond description little boy who is almost 2! At this time in my life I'm slightly overwhelmed with my situation as I'm living with my boyfriend's parents while we wait for the old house to sell. I'm grateful we have a place to stay but I fear once the house is sold we'll still be stuck here do to the housing market being so awful, the interest rates being so high and bankers not being open to giving mortgage loans to those who are self employed like myself.</p>

<p>For the past 18 years I have been doing hair as a licensed cosmetologist. For the past eight years I have been self employed and I love it! One of the things I love about being self-employed is doing my own advertising and seeing the fruits of my labor. I've made pictures and slide shows to promote on instagram as well as done handy things like building a sign holder big enough to hold a 4ftx4ft metal sign to stake in the ground. I thouroghly enjoyed making a website for the salon I rent out of. That website only made using a template however I recieved a lot of compliments on it and a friend asked me to make one for her business too!</p>

<p>Learning to code has been a lot of fun so far. I'm wondering if I might want to just do it as a hobby since the market is already fairly saturated and competetive from what I've heard. Then maybe i'll just purse a career in medical billing in coding instead, in order transiton to a job that's off me feet, wfh and hours that won't hinder my ability to spend time with my son once he gets in school.</p>
